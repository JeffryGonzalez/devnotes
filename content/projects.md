Some of the stuff I'm currently working on.

## JasperFX

I'm really digging into the [Jasper FX Open Source Software - Test Driven Development](https://www.jasperfx.net/) stack. I've been using [Marten | .NET Transactional Document DB and Event Store on PostgreSQL (martendb.io)](https://martendb.io/) for a while, especially the document storage stuff, but have also done a lot with with the [[Event Sourcing]] stuff, and it's fantastic.

I'm digging into [Wolverine](https://wolverine.netlify.app/) - just amazed at the codebase (at [JasperFx/wolverine: Next Generation .NET Command and Message Bus (github.com)](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine)). Learning a ton digging through Jeremy and the team's code. 

I'm particularly digging into the [[Open Telemetry]] stuff, along with the database schema.

## Teaching

Bit of a break right now from teaching. I have some more courses coming up in February 2024.

## Vue

Doing a lot with [[Vue]]. I'm really (mostly) digging it.
