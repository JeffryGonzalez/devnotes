Day 2 of [[Beginning .NET Service Development]].

Finishing a bit of testing this morning - emphasizing testing patterns for CI/CD.

Did some testing with xUnit and Alba yesterday. Was asked about Playwright, did a demo of doing the same thing with that to briefly show this morning. [[Playwright .NET API Testing]]

Emphasized the "Super Power" of developer gray box testing. Want to extend this today in terms of CI/CD. Integrating your code daily means you either have to do day-sized work, or push code that isn't in the chain of execution yet.

The code as we left it yesterday isn't "ready" and shouldn't have been pushed. We could have put the route behind a feature gate (see [Tutorial for using feature flags in a .NET app | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core?tabs=core6x))

Today we will come up with an alternate implementation of the clock.
