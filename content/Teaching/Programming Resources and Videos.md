Text from an email to a student asking about videos/resources for Angular, etc.



  

A couple things that I've benefited from, other than the [https://angular.io](https://angular.io) and [https://angular.dev](https://angular.dev) tutorials:

  

TypeScript Specific Stuff:

  

[Professional TypeScript Training by Matt Pocock | Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/) - this guy is the BEST. Some free stuff, some paid. He tends to be a little React centric, but the TypeScript stuff is the best out there.

Matt's youtube is fire, too: [(2) Matt Pocock - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk)

  

[Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) - Gary Bernhadt is a programming GOD. You get 16 free lessons here, and I pay for it. Not just TypeScript, but Python, Regular Expressions, SQL, stuff like that. And you do it all in the browser with stuff he wrote... blows my mind.

  

  

More Angular Specific:

  

[(2) Rainer Hahnekamp - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RainerHahnekamp) Great stuff, good emphasis on testing.

[(2) Angular - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Angular) the Angular Team's YouTube

[(2) ng-conf - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ngconfonline) - The Angular Conference recorded talks.

  

[(2) Hypertheory Labs - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hypertheorylabs9175) - My channel. The "Counter" thing is there, needs updated. Mash that subscribe button and hit the bell for notifications! I'm going to be adding more over the couple weeks, so, uh, seriously, subscribe. ;)

  

[(2) Brandon Roberts - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BrandonRobertsDev) - The GAWD of NGRX. 

  

[(2) Joshua Morony - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaMorony) - Good stuff, lots of Angular, devolves into Vim stuff, which is cool AND distracting (for me). h

  

  

  

General Web Development:

  

[(2) Web Dev Simplified - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) He does a great job - lots of good stuff.

  

C# Stuff:

  

[(2) Nick Chapsas - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas) This guy is great. Really. But he does irritate me from time to time. 

  

[(2) Raw Coding - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RawCoding) I like this guy's stuff more than Nick's (above), but it isn't as frequent. 

  

[(2) CodeOpinion - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeOpinion) Derek does a great job. Learn a lot from him. Good channel to catch up on architectural stuff in .NET.

  

[(2) Scott Hanselman - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@shanselman) - the "Mr. Rodgers" of the tech world. Watch and read everything he produces, tbh.

  

  

  

General Programming Stuff:

  

[(2) Developer Voices - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloperVoices) - a "podcast" type channel. good stuff usually.

  

[(2) No Boilerplate - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) - great general content.

  

[(2) GitHub - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GitHub)

[(2) Microsoft Developer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MicrosoftDeveloper)

[(2) dotnet - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnet)

  

  

  

DevOps Specific:

  

[(2) DevOps Toolkit - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DevOpsToolkit)

[(2) Continuous Delivery - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ContinuousDelivery)
